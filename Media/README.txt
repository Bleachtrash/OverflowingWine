The contents of the "Media" folder contain the actual assets the game uses (images, fonts, script, etc.).

These assets have been intentionally left editable (mostly because I don't like it when games try to hide their assets from users).

!!By editing these files you will be changing what shows up in-game!!

If you are compelled to mess around with these files I would suggest making a back up of them, and of course, there is no guarantee that your replacement files will be compatible with the game.

!! The format for script.txt is: 
Speaker name (leave a space for no name)
dialogue font style (0 = normal, 1 = bold, 2 = italicized)
contents of dialogue.
(DO NOT ADD A BLANK LINE BETWEEN CHUNKS)!!

The game works off of file names and path. If you are replacing a file, name it accordingly (THIS INCLUDES FILE EXTENSIONS; .txt, .ttf, etc.).
